# Instructions for Running my Project

Hi! I'm so excited to share with you this fun card game of war!

Game instructions:
This is a computer simulation of the old fashion card game called WAR.
In this game one full deck of cards will be shuffled and divided between you and the computer.
Both yours and the computer's cards will remain hidden (face down). In each turn you and the computer will flip your top card.
The one who flipped the card with the higher value gets both cards. They will be added to the bottom of the their pile.
If both you and the computer flip cards that are equal in value, a war is declared.
The war is played by placing face down three additional cards by each player on top of the flipped 'equal' cards (three by you and three by the computer). 
The third card placed by each gets flipped, and the entire pile of war cards is taken by the one who's newly flipped card is higher in value.
The cards are added to the bottom of their pile.
If the cards are equal in value again, another war is declared followed by the same procedure, and so forth.
The one who wins the game is the one who eventually gains all cards.
Be warned! This may take a while.
*I have added many comments that will be displayed during the game. The program should be relatively self-explanatory

Technical matters:
To play the game please use (run) the runner file called 'war_game-runner'
You can use the war_game file that stores most of the code (all functions) to review the code.
I have added as many comments as possible to enable easy comprehension of my code.
If you have any questions, please feel free to comment on GitHub.
I have done my best to test and revise my code for any bugs and errors. If any should still arise, please feel free to let me know via GitHub.
I will do my best to fix any errors in a timely manner.

Enjoy the game!!
