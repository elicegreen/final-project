# Final Project for COP 1000


## Part 1

* provide feedback to classmates on their proposal
* create a rough design of your final project


:ballot_box_with_check: Provide feedback to **Issues** opened by your classmates. **You need to provide feedback to at least 3 classmates for credit.** Some useful feedback would be:
  * does the project seem like too much work to be done in 1 week? If not, how could you suggest the project be modified so it fits into the given timeframe?
  * what obstacles might your classmate have missed?
  * does the project utilize topics learned throughout the semester?
  * does your classmate describe a general plan for achieving his/her desired project? the plan could be an outline, diagram, drawing, written description of programming structure, pseudocode, etc.


:ballot_box_with_check: Keep an eye on your notifications so that you can continue conversations on your own **Issue** but also on the **Issues** in which you have given feedback. When you receive a :+1: from the professor, you can begin implementing.

## Part 2

* solicit feedback from classmates
* provide feedback to classmates

:ballot_box_with_check: Give feedback to your classmates via the [open pull requests page](https://github.com/valencia-cop1000-201620/final-project/pulls). **You need to provide feedback to at least 3 classmates for credit.** Some useful feedback would be:
  * Does the classmate's project run on your computer? Don't be afraid to ask for help if it doesn't, this is a learning experience for both you and the other student.
  * What did you like the most about the project?
  * Is there something that you think the other student could change about the project to make it easier to use, or to improve the quality of the project?
  * Do you yourself understand the concepts the student implemented? You can ask questions as part of the open pull request if you do not.
  * If you'd like to get someone's attention, at-mention them by using the @ symbol and their username (like @halfaro1, for example)
  * Be a cheerleader for your classmates and provide :sparkles:

:ballot_box_with_check: Monitor your own open pull request for feedback from other classmates or the instructor. Incorporate the feedback. When the instructor closes your pull request, you can consider yourself finished. But don't be afraid to introduce new changes or continue the conversation!
